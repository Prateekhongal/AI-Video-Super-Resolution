# AI-Video-Super-Resolution-Using-Dynamic-Upsampling-Filters-Without-Explicit-Motion-Compensation
Video super-resolution (VSR) has become even more important recently to provide high resolution (HR) contents for ultra high definition displays. While many deep learning based VSR methods have been proposed, most of them rely heavily on the accuracy of motion estimation and compensation.  This is a novel end-to-end deep neural network that generates dynamic upsampling filters and a residual image, which are computed depending on the local spatio-temporal neighborhood of each pixel to avoid explicit motion compensation.
